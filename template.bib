# use http://cassi.cas.org/search.jsp and other indexes to find the abbreviations for each journal
# can use a combination of google scholar, website specific citation tools or crossref to obtain a source bibtex for each reference
# I prefer using the naming scheme from google scholar for referencing

# might need to download specific .bst file for a journal
